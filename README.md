# Movie Rating Prediction

A **Flask** web application for predicting **IMDb ratings**. This project allows users to input key movie attributes—**Duration**, **Log(Votes)**, **Decade**, and **Genres**—to receive a model-generated rating estimate. The model leverages **XGBoost** for regression, along with a custom cleaning and feature-engineering pipeline.
